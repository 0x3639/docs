# Zenon Network

What is [Zenon Network](https://zenon.network)?

Zenon is a Layer-1 blockchain network built by [cypherpunks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypherpunk). Its ethos mirrors Bitcoin's, with a long-term vision to make Bitcoin smart, fast, and feeless. Zenon overcomes the blockchain trilemma through its innovative dual-ledger architecture, dual-token economy, and hybrid consensus combining Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS). 

The following video, released by the founding devs in 2021, illustrates the project's vision:
