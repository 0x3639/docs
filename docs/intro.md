# Zenon Network

What is [Zenon Network](https://zenon.network)?

Zenon is a Layer-1 blockchain network built by cypherpunks. Its ethos mirrors Bitcoin's, with a long-term vision to make Bitcoin smart, fast, and feeless.

Zenon, The Network of Momentum (NoM) solves the blockchain trilemma through:

- **Dual-Coin Economy**
  - $ZNN: Governance and staking token
  - $QSR: Network resource token for transaction processing

- **Hybrid Consensus**
  - Proof of Work (PoW): Network security and chain-weight
  - Proof of Stake (PoS): Scalability and transaction speed

- **Dual-Ledger Architecture**
  - Block Lattice: Enables instant, feeless transactions
  - Meta-DAG: Provides leaderless, fast consensus

- **Zero-Fee Transactions**
  - Transactions are processed using either:
    - Small PoW computation
    - Fused $QSR tokens

- **Layer 2 Smart Contracts**
  - Specialized unikernel architecture
  - Fast execution on L2 with L1 settlement
  - Isolated runtime environment

The following video, released by the founding team in 2021, illustrates the project's vision:
