# Getting Started

Zenon Network, The Network of Momentum (NoM) is a next-generation blockchain platform that optimizes decentralization, scalability, and efficiency through its innovative dual-ledger architecture. It combines Proof of Work (PoW) for transaction security and chain-weight with Proof of Stake (PoS) for scalable consensus, leveraging the strengths of both mechanisms. The network's unique architecture distributes roles between Sentinels (transaction relayers and decentralized application hosts) and Pillars (consensus validators). Designed to integrate seamlessly with external networks like Bitcoin and run lightweight unikernel-based zApps, Zenon Network serves as a modular framework for building decentralized, trustless applications tailored for mass adoption.

NoM attempts to overcome the blockchain trilemma by leveraging existing cryptographic primitives in a novel approach: 

- **Dual-Coin Economy**
  - $ZNN: Governance and staking token
  - $QSR: Network resource token for transaction processing

- **Hybrid Consensus**
  - Proof of Work (PoW): Network security and chain-weight
  - Proof of Stake (PoS): Scalability and transaction speed

- **Dual-Ledger Architecture**
  - Block Lattice: Enables instant, feeless transactions
  - Meta-DAG: Provides leaderless, fast consensus

- **Zero-Fee Transactions**
  - Transactions are processed using either:
    - Small PoW computation
    - Fused $QSR tokens

- **Layer 2 Smart Contracts**
  - Specialized unikernel architecture
  - Fast execution on L2 with L1 settlement
  - Isolated runtime environment
