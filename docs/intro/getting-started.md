# Getting Started

Welcome to **Zenon Network**, the Network of Momentum (NoM). Zenon is a next-generation blockchain that strives to solve the “blockchain trilemma” by offering a network that is secure, scalable, and truly decentralized.

Zenon aims to bring fast, feeless transactions to Bitcoin while introducing the world to zApps. By combining cutting-edge cryptographic primitives with an innovative architecture, Zenon delivers a highly scalable, efficient, and decentralized ecosystem for application of the future.

## A Brief History and Vision

Zenon’s journey began its public journel in 2018 when 'ProfessorZ' introduced the community to the project in a [Bitcoin Talk forum post](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4281633.0).  Over the next three years a group of anon developers worked to lauch alphanet in 2021. Since then the project was turned over to the community where they work towards delivering Phase 1. From the beginning Zenon has embraced decentralization, egalitarianism, and community-driven growth. Unlike many projects, Zenon was launched with no pre-sales, VCs, and insider allocations.

The project embodies Satoshi Nakamoto’s ethos, aiming to complement Bitcoin rather than compete with it. By leveraging its novel architecture, Zenon aspires to make Bitcoin scalable, interoperable, and truly programmable.

## The Architecture: Network of Momentum (NoM)

Zenon’s Network of Momentum introduces a **dual-ledger architecture** that separates transaction handling from consensus. This design allows for unparalleled scalability, instant transactions, and robust decentralization.

- **Block Lattice**: Each account has its own chain, enabling asynchronous updates and high throughput.
- **Meta-DAG**: Facilitates leaderless Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus using virtual voting (under development).
- **Hybrid Consensus**: Combines Proof of Work (PoW) for security and Proof of Stake (PoS) for scalability.

## Key Features

### 1. **Zero-Fee Transactions**
   - Transactions are powered by **fused $QSR tokens** or minimal PoW, eliminating traditional fees.
   - Enables mass adoption by reducing barriers to entry.

### 2. **Dual-Coin Economy**
   - **$ZNN**: Governance and staking token.
   - **$QSR**: Network utility token for enabling transactions and zApps.

### 3. **Layered Smart Contract Design**
   - zApps (Zenon Applications) operate on unikernels, ensuring lightweight and isolated execution environments.
   - Layer-1 provides security; Layer-2 ensures scalability and speed.

### 4. **Modular Framework**
   - Supports interoperability with networks like Bitcoin.
   - Facilitates future innovations such as NFTs, DeFi, and cross-chain bridges.

### 5. **Extreme Scalability**
   - Asynchronous account chains and minimalistic L1 ensure the system remains fast and efficient as it grows.

## The Zenon Ethos

Zenon stands apart with its commitment to decentralization and fairness:
- **Community-Centric Development**: Entirely run and governed by the community since 2023.
- **Grassroots Growth**: Prioritizes word-of-mouth and organic adoption over centralized marketing.

## Getting Involved

Zenon Network offers numerous opportunities for contributors, developers, and enthusiasts:
1. **Run a Pillar or Sentinel Node**: Strengthen the network by validating transactions or relaying data.
2. **Develop on NoM**: Build unikernel-based zApps or contribute to Zenon's infrastructure.
3. **Engage with the Community**: Participate in governance, collaborate on projects, or join initiatives like Accelerator-Z to fund your ideas.
