# Getting Started

Welcome to **Zenon Network**, the Network of Momentum (NoM). Zenon is a next-generation blockchain that strives to solve the “blockchain trilemma” by offering a network that is secure, scalable, and truly decentralized.

Zenon will bring fast, feeless transactions to Bitcoin and will introduce the world to a new smart contract architecture that will bring blockchain to web2. By combining cutting-edge cryptography with an innovative architecture, Zenon delivers a highly scalable, secure, and decentralized ecosystem for applications of the future.

"If we need to limit the scope of Zenon and the Network of Momentum under a single specific use-case, the following one should be the most appropriate — a robust platform designed to unlock a new dimension of possibilities for apps."

## A Brief History and Vision

Zenon began its `public` journel in 2018 when 'ProfessorZ' introduced the project in a [Bitcoin Talk forum post](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4281633.0) along with a [website](https://web.archive.org/web/20190620123400/https://zenon.network/#intro) and [Lightpaper](https://web.archive.org/web/20191213102712/https://zenon.network/res/lightpaper.pdf). Over the next three years a group of anon developers worked to lauch alphanet in 2021. Since then the project was turned over to the community where they work towards delivering Phase 1. From the beginning, Zenon has embraced decentralization, egalitarianism, and community-driven growth. Unlike many projects, Zenon was launched with no pre-sales, VCs, and insider allocations.

The project embodies Bitcoin’s ethos, aiming to complement rather than compete with it. By leveraging its novel architecture, Zenon aspires to make Bitcoin highly scalable, interoperable, and truly programmable.

## The Architecture

Zenon introduces a **dual-ledger architecture** that separates transaction handling from consensus. This design allows for unparalleled scalability, instant transactions, and robust decentralization.

- **Block Lattice**: Each account has its own account chain, enabling asynchronous updates and high throughput.
- **Meta-DAG**: Facilitates leaderless, censorship resistant, Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus using virtual voting (under development).
- **Hybrid Consensus**: Will provide Proof of Work (PoW) for security and Proof of Stake (PoS) for scalability with the introduction of Sentinels.

## Key Features

### 1. **Feeless Transactions**
   - Transactions are powered by **fused $QSR** or minimal PoW, eliminating traditional fees.
   - Enables mass adoption by reducing barriers to entry.

### 2. **Dual-Coin Economy**
   - **$ZNN**: Governance and staking token.
   - **$QSR**: Network utility token for enabling transactions and zApps.

### 3. **Layered Smart Contract Design**
   - zApps (Zenon Applications) operate on unikernels, ensuring lightweight and isolated execution environments.
   - Layer-1 provides security; Layer-2 offers a smart contract runtime.

This image illustrates the Layer 2 architecture powering Zenon's smart contracts, seamlessly interacting with the Layer 1 for settlement and consensus.

### 4. **Modular Framework**
   - Supports interoperability with networks like Bitcoin.
   - Facilitates future innovations such as NFTs, DeFi, and cross-chain bridges.

### 5. **Extreme Scalability**
   - Asynchronous account chains and minimalistic L1 ensure the system remains fast and efficient as it grows.

## The Zenon Ethos

Zenon is committed to decentralization:
- **Community-Centric Development**: Entirely run and governed by the community since 2023.
- **Grassroots Growth**: Prioritizes word-of-mouth and organic adoption over centralized marketing.
- **AltZ**: Contributors have a unique way of "spawning" and "rugging" various <span class="tooltip">"AltZ"<img src="/img/crypto-publius.jpg" alt="AltZ Example" class="tooltip-publius"/></span> that participate in the project. 

## Getting Involved

Zenon Network offers numerous opportunities for contributors, developers, and enthusiasts:
1. **Run a Pillar or Sentinel Node**: Strengthen the network by validating transactions or relaying data.
2. **Develop on NoM**: Build unikernel-based zApps or contribute to Zenon's infrastructure.
3. **Engage with the Community**: Participate in governance, collaborate on projects, or join initiatives like [Accelerator-Z](https://medium.com/@Zyler9985/zenon-network-how-to-apply-for-a-funding-grant-e977b7efce0d) to fund your ideas.
