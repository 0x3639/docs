# RPC API Documentation Test Report

Generated: 2025-01-06
Test Node: wss://my.hc1node.com:35998

## Summary

Testing in progress. Core API documentation completed. Embedded contract APIs testing underway. Real data has been successfully integrated into the documentation examples.

## Files Updated

### 1. `/docs/developer/rpc-api/index.md`
- **Method**: `ledger.getAccountInfoByAddress`
- **Status**: ✅ Updated with real data
- **Changes**: 
  - Updated address to working example: `z1qrztagl9rukq3ltdflnvg4zrvpfp84mydfejk9`
  - Response now shows actual account data with real token balances
  - Includes comprehensive token list demonstrating real-world response

### 2. `/docs/developer/rpc-api/core/stats.md`
- **Methods tested**: 4
- **Status**: 3/4 successful

| Method | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| `stats.osInfo` | ✅ | Updated with real system information |
| `stats.processInfo` | ✅ | Updated with actual node version (v0.0.8) |
| `stats.networkInfo` | ✅ | Updated with real peer list and connection data |
| `stats.runtimeInfo` | ❌ | Method does not exist/is not available |
| `stats.syncInfo` | ✅ | Added real response with sync state information |

### 3. `/docs/developer/rpc-api/core/dual-ledger.md`
- **Methods tested**: 13
- **Status**: All successful
- **Changes**:
  - Updated `getFrontierAccountBlock` with working address and real response
  - Updated `getAccountBlockByHash` with valid hash from network
  - Replaced non-existent addresses with fallback address

### 4. `/docs/developer/rpc-api/core/subscribe.md`
- **Methods tested**: 4 subscription types
- **Status**: All successful  
- **Changes**:
  - Updated all subscription examples with real subscription IDs
  - Replaced example addresses with working fallback address
  - All subscription methods tested and verified working

## Discovered Issues

1. **stats.runtimeInfo**: This method is documented but not implemented in the current node version. Documentation has been updated to reflect this.

2. **Address validity**: Many example addresses in the documentation do not exist on the network. These need to be systematically replaced with the fallback address.

## Next Steps

1. **Test remaining Core API files**:
   - `core/dual-ledger.md` - Account and momentum operations
   - `core/subscribe.md` - WebSocket subscriptions

2. **Test all Embedded Contract APIs** (12 files):
   - pillar.md, plasma.md, sentinel.md, token.md
   - stake.md, swap.md, accelerator.md, spork.md
   - htlc.md, bridge.md, liquidity.md

3. **Handle special parameters**:
   - Transaction hashes
   - Momentum hashes
   - HTLC IDs
   - Token standards
   - Pillar names

## Recommendations

1. Use `z1qrztagl9rukq3ltdflnvg4zrvpfp84mydfejk9` as the default address for all examples
2. Query for valid hashes and IDs before testing methods that require them
3. Document which methods require special setup or existing blockchain state
4. Consider adding a note about test data availability for methods that reference specific transactions or contracts

## Current Testing Progress (Embedded Contracts)

**Currently testing**: Token and Pillar APIs

**Token API findings**:
- `embedded.token.getAll` - ✅ Working (274 tokens found)
- `embedded.token.getByZts` - ✅ Working with ZNN token

**Pillar API findings**:
- `embedded.pillar.getAll` - ✅ Working (96 pillars found)  
- `embedded.pillar.getByName` - ✅ Working with real pillar "DeeZNNutz.com"
- `embedded.pillar.getQsrRegistrationCost` - ✅ Working

## Overall Progress

- Total files to test: 16
- Files completed: 4 (index.md, stats.md, dual-ledger.md, subscribe.md)
- Files remaining: 12
- Methods successfully updated: 25+
- Methods with errors: 1 (stats.runtimeInfo - not implemented)
